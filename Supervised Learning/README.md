# Supervised Machine Learning 
In supervised learning, we train your model on a labelled dataset that means we have both raw input data as well as its results. We split our data into a training dataset and test dataset where the training dataset is used to train our model whereas the test dataset acts as new data for predicting results or to see the accuracy of our model.

### Supervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:
- Classification: Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories. We use classification when we want our result to reflect the belongingness of data points in the dataset.

A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Apple” or “Banana” or “Red” and “Blue”.

- Regression: Regression gives us continuous results that allow you to better distinguish between individual point.

A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
