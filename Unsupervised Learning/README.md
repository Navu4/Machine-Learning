# Unsupervised Machine Learning 

In unsupervised learning, the information used to train is neither classified nor labelled in the dataset. Unsupervised learning studies on how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabelled data. The main task of unsupervised learning is to find patterns in the data.

### Unsupervised learning classified into two categories of algorithms:
- Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.
- Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data.
