### What is K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering Algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm in which we use unlabeled data, the data without defined categories or groups, and try to split the data into clusters or segments. K-Means is an algorithm that trains the model and divides the data into different categories or groups. In other words, they group similar objects or data points.
